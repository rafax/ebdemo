Elastic Beanstalk Intro
What we plan to deploy:
    - simple (Scala+Spring-boot if possible) app that binds to a port, exposes an API endpoint accepting parameters, takes config from environment
    - HA RDS instance to show DB failover
How will we deploy:
    EB + Docker + fat-jar
Features to show:
    - config from environment
    - ELB load balancing instances
    - healthchecks
    - ELB healing instances
    - DB failover resulting in instances switching to new server
    - "runtime" configuration
