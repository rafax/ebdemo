Elastic Beanstalk Intro
What we plan to deploy:
    - simple app that:
        - binds to a port
        - exposes an API endpoint for calculating factorials
        - stores calculations and hit count in Postgres DB
        - takes config from environment
    - HA RDS instance to show DB failover
How will we deploy:
    EB + Docker inside a private VPC
Features to show:
    - config from environment
    - ELB load balancing instances
    - healthchecks
    - ELB healing instances
    - "runtime" configuration
    - securing the environment
Optional (if we have time):
    - CNAME
    - SSL certificates
    - autoscaling
    - migrations
    - monitoring
    - DB failover resulting in instances switching to new server
